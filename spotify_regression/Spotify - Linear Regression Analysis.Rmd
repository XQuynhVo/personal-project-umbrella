This is one of the projects from the Regression Analysis course in my third year undergrad. The analysis is conducted on the data set I was given in the course. I uploaded the data file (`spotify.csv`) in the same folder containing this Rmarkdown file. For those who saw this on my personal website, please go to my [Github](https://github.com/XQuynhVo) for the code.

Let's start with having a look at the data set.

```{r import}
#import data
df <- read.csv("spotify.csv")
head(df)
```

```{r check general info}
#look at the structure of df
str(df)
```
```{r check cleanliness}
#count missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(df))
```

The data set contains 114000 songs on Spotify with 8 other variables representing the recorded features relating to a song.

All the variables are of numeric type, thus we can go ahead with looking at the summary statistics as well as some plots for a quick grasp of their distributions, which is part of the phase in the Data Life Cycle often referred as **Explanatory Data Analysis** (EDA).

```{r sum stats}
#summary statistics
summary(df)
```

From the above information, my understanding of these variables are:
- `popularity`: a quantity representing how popular a song is relative to all the recorded songs, on a 1-100 scale.
- `duration_ms`: time length of a song, measured in milliseconds.
- `danceability`: a quantity representing how easy a song can make its listeners moving with the beat, normalized to a 0.0 - 1.0 scale.
- `energy`: a quantity measuring intensity of a song, can be based on how loud, or fast a song is (`tempo`), normalized to a 0.0 - 1.0 scale.
- `acousticness`: a quantity measuring the amount of recorded acoustic instrument present in a track, in contrast to synthesized, or electronic amplification, normalized to a 0.0 - 1.0 scale.
- `instrumentalness`: a quantity measuring the amount of instrument (non-lyrical) component in a song, as opposed to vocal component (lyric), normalized to a 0.0 - 1.0 scale. 
- `liveness`: a quantity measuring the presence of audience or noise of a recorded song, normalized to a 0.0 - 1.0 scale.
- `tempo`: a quantity measuring how fast the beat of a song is.

We can also look closer at the distribution of each features by plotting their histograms.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(colnames(df))) {
  #print(colnames(df)[i])
  plotName = cat("Distribution of ", colnames(df)[i])
  hist(data.matrix(df[colnames(df)[i]]),
       main = plotName,
       xlab = colnames(df)[i])
}
```

In general, this dataset looks fairly good and normalized, with features like `danceablity`, `energy`, `acousticness`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness` range between 0 and 1. `Popularity` seems to have been adjusted to the 0-100 scale. However, a potential issue stands out for `duration_ms` for some extreme outliers, as also pointed out in the histogram for `duration_ms`, (songs lasting over 5 million ms ≈ 87 minutes, which is unusual for typical songs).

```{r 1st model}
# Fit a linear model
model1 = lm(popularity ~ ., data=df)

# result 1
summary(model1)
```
First, the p-value obtained from the F-test is very small (< 2.2e-16), which shows that at least one of these predictors explain popularity, or overall the model does explain popularity. However, R-squared = 0.01 is very small, even after accounted for a large number of predictors, the adjusted R-squared = 0.0113 (~ 1.13%) shows the model explains little about the relationship of interest. This suggests a song popularity may be not be captured by these characteristics alone. The ANOVA table provides more evidence for this.

```{r anova 1}
# create a null model to compare
null_model1 = lm(popularity ~ 1, data = df)

# anova table
anova(null_model1, model1)
```

Second, looking closer to the p-values for each t-test, the intercept, danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness and tempo statistically appear have a significant influence on a song's popularity. Specifically, energy, acousticness and instrumentalness have negative impact whereas the intercept, danceability and tempo have positive impact on popularity.

Recall from the plots among all the covariates in the EDA step, we noticed that there are a great number of observation for `popularity` with value 0. We may want to address this to improve our model.

```{r subseted df}
df2 = subset(df, popularity > 0)
head(df2)
```

Let's fit a second model using this subseted dataframe.

```{r 2nd model}
# refitted model 
model2 = lm(popularity~., data=df2)
summ2 = summary(model2); summ2
```

Now we check our assumptions using diagnostic plots to see what has changed.

```{r refitted QQ plot}
qqPlot(model2$residuals, distribution="norm", pch=1, col="red", xlab="Theoretical normal quantiles", ylab="Sample quantiles")
```

In the Q-Q plot, we notice many points originally below the line now are onto the line. The S-shape still remains.

```{r refitted histogram of residuals}
hist(model2$residuals,breaks = 100, xlab="Residuals", main="Histogram of residuals", freq=FALSE, xlim=c(-60,60), ylim=c(0,0.030))
curve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(model2$residuals), sd=sd(model2$residuals)), 
      col="darkblue", lwd=2, add=TRUE)
```

A great number of points overestimating popularity scores (points with residuals around $-40$) have been removed. The histogram fits in the area under the normal curve much more, but still has lighter tails than the normal curve.

```{r refitted studentized res vs. fitted values}
#studentized residuals
studentized_res2 = rstudent(model2)

#plot
plot(model2$fitted.values, studentized_res2, xlab="Fitted values", ylab="Studentized residuals", pch=1)
```

The plot of the studentized residuals against the fitted values for popularity shows that the model tends to underestimate popularity score that are less than $20$. For values that are greater than $20$, we see that the variance of residuals increases as popularity score increases. The assumption of the errors being identically distributed is still not satisfied. However, the Q-Q plot and the histogram of residuals show that the normality assumption is better respected.

This model fits the data better compared to our previous model, as we obtained higher value for $R^2_{adj}=0.045$, which is still not so great.

We got some good information so far, but still not very useful. We can try tweaking a little bit to see what else can we exploit from this model. We may guess that there may be some relationship between our predictors (for example, a song that is more acoustic tends to be less energetic, or danceable). Apparently, if it is really the case, we are violating the assumptions of a linear regression model (the predicting variables must be independent). Thus, let's have a check.

```{r 3rd model}
### Let's fit a second model without `acousticness`
model3 = lm(popularity ~ .-acousticness, data = df2)

# result 3
summary(model3)
```
```{r coefficient shift}
# change in coefficients
print("Coefficient shift: ")
model3$coefficients - model2$coefficients[-5] #omit `acousticness` in model 2
# coefficient shift: energy (-8.5 to -4.2 -> large increase), danceability (2.3 to 2.8)
```

First, we notice that adjusted R-squared drops, this makes sense as we remove `acousticness` and it is a significant predictor. And then, `duration_ms` and `liveness`, which were insignificant before now become weakly significant. This may be an evidence for another guess about the relationship between `liveness` and `acousticness` since acoustic tracks are often recorded live.

Also, a closer look at the coefficients shows that removing `acousticness`, which has a negative effect on popularity, coefficient of `energy` increases. This shows `acousticness` and `energy` are correlated, verifying our guess about acoustic songs tend to be less energetic. Or by looking at the growth in `danceability` coefficient, we may guess `acousticness` was “masking” part of `danceability`’s effect since acoustic songs are often less danceable.

A more direct way to check for correlation between predictors (`multicollinearity`) is to use the correlation matrix.

```{r correlation matrix}
# correlation matrix
cor(subset(df2, select = -popularity))
```

`energy` is shown to negatively correlate with `acousticness`.

Another more convention way to check for `collinearity`.
